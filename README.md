### Summary of React Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation**:
    
    - Understanding XSS attacks (stored, reflected, and DOM-based).
    - Using React’s built-in protections like JSX escaping.
    - Avoiding the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention**:
    
    - Understanding CSRF attacks and their implications.
    - Using techniques like the synchronizer token pattern.
    - Implementing CSRF protection in a React + Node.js setup.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    
    - Implementing and configuring CSP to restrict unauthorized scripts.
    - Using nonces and understanding their role in script security.
4. **Handling User Input**:
    
    - Validating and sanitizing all user inputs.
    - Using libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML.
5. **Client-Side Security Practices**:
    
    - Preventing sensitive information exposure in client-side code.
    - Using `useRef` to manage DOM elements securely.
    - Understanding the implications of viewing source code and sensitive data exposure.
6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    
    - Secure logging practices to avoid exposing sensitive information.
    - Logging security-specific events and understanding asynchronous logging.
7. **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting**:
    
    - Enhancing security and performance with lazy loading.
    - Applying the principle of least privilege to secure administrative components.
8. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Security**:
    
    - Securing SSR with proper data handling and avoiding template injections.
    - Understanding the pros and cons of SSR from a security perspective.
9. **Handling Raw Data and JSON**:
    
    - Safely embedding JSON data and using serialization techniques.
    - Avoiding XSS through proper data serialization and encoding.
10. **Defense Mechanisms**:
    
    - Using tools like OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning.
    - Understanding the importance of continuous security practices.
